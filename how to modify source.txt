Q. how to add more in debug slot?

remember last empty line is required.

Q. what are offset_x and offset_y in ./data/obj_x.txt?
on the object creation, the location of invokation will be adjusted with those values.




delete_object should be used when delete Object. 
delete_object will defragment object array so that no deleted object will be between alive object. 
this make it easy to set last object index. 
if last object index is known, there's no need to loop 500x500 times.
